how to write plugin documentation                  *plugin_template_docs_meta*

There is quite a bit of variation in the way people write vim-style
documentation.

See `:h help-writing` for some guidelines and basically just copy all the popular
plugins.

When writing help files, it's useful to have this at the bottom:
`vim:tw=78:ft=help`
This is a `modeline`, and it will give you some pretty syntax highlighting,
even though you're just in a normal .txt file.

IMPORTANT: once you've written the help file, you need to run
`:helptags doc`
from the root directory of your plugin. This will generate the `tags` file that
lets neovim know which search terms correspond to the tags in your help file.
Remember that tags are surrounded by asterisks. It is conventional for all of
your tags to start with the name of the plugin for easy searching.

how to setup the plugin                    *plugin_template_docs_installation*
>lua
    require('plugin').setup({options})

        Set up your plugin. Call this function to set things up.
        Use the {options} in some way. (there aren't actually any options)
        Do setup. I'm trying to fill space here.

vim:tw=78:ft=help
